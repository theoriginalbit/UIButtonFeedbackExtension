# UIButton Extension â€“ Haptic Feedback 

A very simple library that provides a `UIButton` extension that enables use of [Haptic Feedback](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/haptics/) on touch down, touch up, or both.

To enable haptics it is as simple as the following

```swift
let button = UIButton()

button.feedbackOnTouchUp = true
button.feedbackOnTouchDown = true
```

You may also access the `UISelectionFeedbackGenerator` under the read-only `feedbackGenerator` property. Note, this generator will be `nil` if both of the feedback settings are `false`.
